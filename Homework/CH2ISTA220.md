1. What is a local variable?  
A: Variables that exist only in a method or small are of code.
2. What is a statement?  
A: A command that performs an action.
3. What is an identifier?  
A: The names that you use to identify the elements in your programs. i.e. namespaces, classes, methods and variables. 
4. What is a variable?  
A: A storage location that holds a value. 
5. What is a method?  
A: A names sequence of statements. 
6. Are primitive types and value types the same thing? See pg. 177  
A: Not exactly, value types are primitive types as a collective.
7. How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?  
A: You use arithmetic operators to define variables.
8. How do you turn an integer into a string?  
A: String interpolation, using brackets.
9. How do you turn a string into an integer?  
A: Call the System.iint32.parse method
10. What is the difference between precedence and associativity?  
A: Give an example where this makes a difference? Precedence is the order in which operators are evaluated while associativity is the direction in which operands of an operator are evaluated. 15/5*3
11. What is the definite assignment rule?  
A: Every variable needs to be assigned a value.
12. How are the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators evaluated differently?  
A: It's the timing of when the subjected value is increased. ++number evaluates number with the one added first while number++ would evaluate number first then add the 1.
13. What is string interpolation?  
A: You use the $ sign to denote that anything between the brackets should be evaluated and requires a returned value. 
14. What does the var keyword do?  
 A: Causes the compiler to deduce the type of the variables from the types of the expressions used to initialize them.
